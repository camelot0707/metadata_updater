# metadata_updater
 a script that will update all your pics' metadata according to the file name, to "repair" missing metadata as a result of using tools such as whatsapp that delete the original metadata

## Requirements
- Python 3.11+ (consider using anaconda https://anaconda.org/ as you'll be able to swap between python versions easily)
- ExifTool (https://exiftool.org/) (included in the folder when pulled/cloned)
